## Requirements

* [Git](https://git-scm.com) v2.17 or later
* [Pick](https://github.com/mptre/pick): A fuzzy search tool for the command-line

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you donâ€™t want or need. Donâ€™t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

**1. Clone this repository:**

```sh
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ahmed-taj/dotfiles.git
```

**2. Run the installation script:**

> **Caution:** The script will override existing files (e.g. .bashrc, .bash_profile ..etc)

This will create symlinks from this repo to your home folder.

```sh
$ ./install.sh
```

**3. Enable GNOME snazzy theme (optional):**

If you're a GNOME user and would like to try out the snazzy theme ([hyper-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy) clone) simply run:

```sh
$ ./snazzy/gnome.sh
```

## Features

* ðŸ–¥ Both `bash` and `zsh` are supported
* ðŸ”¥ [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) + [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) out of the box
* ðŸ¦„ [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) prompt
* ðŸ’… Gnome Snazzy theme (inspired by [hyper-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy))

**It also includes:**

* [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm): The popular Node Version Manager as git submodule + shell integrations.

## Customization

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you donâ€™t want to commit to a public repository.

> **NOTE:** the `~/.extra` file will be used by both `bash` and `zsh` so mind your shell syntax.

**Example:**

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# Git credentials
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="user"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="user@email.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```
