# Dotfiles

My personal Ubuntu/Debian configurations for zsh, nvm, terminals and more. It also provides a script to automate the installation of software I commonly use.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Super fast shell startup.
- ðŸ’… Minimal and beautiful prompt.
- ðŸ”¥ Fuzzy completion + key bindings.
- ðŸ’¤ Lazy load shell modules when possible.

## Dependencies

- [**python**][python]: requires v3.5 or later in order to run the scripts.
- [**antibody**][antibody]: a shell plugin manager made from the ground up thinking about performance.
- [**starship**][starship]: The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell.
- [**fzf**][fzf]: a command-line fuzzy finder to filter files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc.
- [**fd**][fd]: a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to `find` that automatically respects `.gitignore` files.
